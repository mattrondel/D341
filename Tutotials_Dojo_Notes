** Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation

AWS Personal Health Dashboard provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may impact you. While the Service Health Dashboard displays the general status of AWS services, Personal Health Dashboard gives you a personalized view into the performance and availability of the AWS services underlying your AWS resources.

The dashboard displays relevant and timely information to help you manage events in progress, and provides proactive notification to help you plan for scheduled activities. With Personal Health Dashboard, alerts are triggered by changes in the health of AWS resources, giving you event visibility, and guidance to help quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

CloudWatch only monitors the health of the resources that you own based on certain metrics but it does not check the underlying hardware that hosts the AWS resources.

Service Health Dashboard monitors the entire health of the services provided by AWS in a global scale and not just your account

CloudTrail is primarily used for API logging and not to check the health status of the AWS resources.


** Security and Compliance

To grant permission to everyone, also referred as anonymous access, you set the wildcard (“*”) as the Principal value. For example, if you configure your bucket as a website, you want all the objects in the bucket to be publicly accessible.


** Cost and Performance Optimization

If your EC2 instance goes from the pending state to the terminated state immediately after restarting then it could be caused by one of the following reasons:

	You’ve reached your EBS volume limit.
	An EBS snapshot is corrupt.
	The root EBS volume is encrypted and you do not have permissions to access the KMS key for decryption.
	The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part (an image.part.xx file).
	

** Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation

You can aggregate the metrics for AWS resources across multiple accounts and Regions. For example, you can aggregate statistics for your EC2 instances that have detailed monitoring enabled. Instances that use basic monitoring are not included. Therefore, you must enable detailed monitoring (at an additional charge), which provides data in 1-minute periods.


** Monitoring, Logging, and Remediation

The AWS Health Dashboard is the single place to learn about the availability and operations of AWS services. You can view the overall status of AWS services, and you can sign in to view personalized communications about your particular AWS account or organization. Your account view provides deeper visibility into resource issues, upcoming changes, and important notifications.

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online resource which helps you reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment, and it also provides real time guidance to help you provision your resources while following AWS best practices. It does not, however, tell you if there are events that occur with AWS that will affect your business.

AWS IAM is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated and authorized to use resources.

AWS Billing Dashboard is used to monitor your AWS usage, and budget your costs. It shows all relevant information regarding your billing in AWS


** Security and Compliance

AWS CloudTrail is a service that provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service. CloudTrail captures API calls as events. For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, you create a trail. A trail enables CloudTrail to deliver log files of events to an Amazon S3 bucket.

Amazon Detective  collects the log data from your AWS resources automatically, and does not track the API calls.

AWS IAM Access Analyzer this service only identifies the resources in your organization and accounts that are shared with an external entity.


** Reliability and Business Continuity

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

Network Load Balancer is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. Network Load Balancer is also optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.


** Networking and Content Delivery

An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it. By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance.


** Cost and Performance Optimization

AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources. Systems Manager simplifies resource and application management, shortens the time to detect and resolve operational problems, and makes it easy to operate and manage your infrastructure securely at scale.

These are the automation capabilities of Systems Manager that you can perform on EC2 instances:

– Build automation to configure and manage instances and AWS resources.

– Create custom runbooks or use pre-defined runbooks maintained by AWS.

– Receive notifications about Automation tasks and runbooks by using Amazon EventBridge.

– Monitor Automation progress and details by using the AWS Systems Manager console.


** Reliability and Business Continuity

Amazon RDS creates and saves automated backups of your DB instance during the backup window of your DB instance. RDS creates a storage volume snapshot of your DB instance, backing up the entire DB instance and not just individual databases. RDS saves the automated backups of your DB instance according to the backup retention period that you specify. By default, an RDS created from the AWS console has backup retention of 7 days. You can further modify this backup retention period between 0-35 days.

Amazon Aurora backs up your cluster volume automatically and retains restore data for the length of the backup retention period. Aurora backups are continuous and incremental, so you can quickly restore to any point within the backup retention period. No performance impact or interruption of database service occurs as backup data is being written. You can specify a backup retention period, from 1 to 35 days, when you create or modify a DB cluster.

S3 has a lifecycle policy but not a backup policy. Standard S3 is already very durable, and AWS has no options for automatic backup on S3.

Although EBS volumes can be automatically backed up using AWS Backup, they don’t support auto-scaling storage-wise.

AWS DataSync is just a data transfer tool

** Security and Compliance

You can use environment variables to adjust your function’s behavior without updating code. An environment variable is a pair of strings that are stored in a function’s version-specific configuration. The Lambda runtime makes environment variables available to your code and sets additional environment variables that contain information about the function and invocation request.

To increase database security it is recommend that you use AWS Secrets Manager instead of environment variables to store database credentials.


** Cost and Performance Optimization
Amazon CloudWatch is basically a metrics repository. An AWS service — such as Amazon EC2 —puts metrics into the repository, and you retrieve statistics based on those metrics. If you put your own custom metrics into the repository, you can retrieve statistics on these metrics as well.

You can use metrics to calculate statistics and then present the data graphically in the CloudWatch console. You can configure alarm actions to stop, start, or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance when certain criteria are met. In addition, you can create alarms that initiate Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling and Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) actions on your behalf.


** Networking and Content Delivery

To create an active-passive failover configuration with one primary record and one secondary record, you just create the records and specify Failover for the routing policy. When the primary resource is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the primary record. When the primary resource is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the secondary record.

Check the health of EC2 instances and other resources (non-alias records)

If you’re routing traffic to resources that you can’t create alias records for, such as EC2 instances, you create a record and a health check for each resource. Then you associate each health check with the applicable record. Health checks regularly check the health of the corresponding resources, and Route 53 routes traffic only to the resources that health checks report as healthy.


** Deployment, Provisioning, and Automation

Amazon RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy for Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) that makes applications more scalable, more resilient to database failures, and more secure.

Many applications, including those built on modern serverless architectures, can have a large number of open connections to the database server, and may open and close database connections at a high rate, exhausting database memory and compute resources. Amazon RDS Proxy allows applications to pool and share connections established with the database, improving database efficiency and application scalability.


** Security and Compliance

AWS Artifact is your go-to central resource for compliance-related information that matters to you. It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. Agreements available in AWS Artifact include the Business Associate Addendum (BAA) and the Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA).

** Networking and Content Delivery
If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency.

** Security and Compliance

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor checks help optimize your AWS infrastructure, increase security and performance, reduce your overall costs, and monitor service limits. Whether establishing new workflows, developing applications, or as part of ongoing improvement, take advantage of the recommendations provided by Trusted Advisor on a regular basis to help keep your solutions provisioned optimally.
