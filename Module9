Metrics are a fundamental concept in CloudWatch. A metric represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch. Think of a metric as a variable to monitor and the data point represent the values of that variable over time. Data points themselves can come from any application or business activity that you collect data from.
Metrics are uniquely defined by a name, namespace and zero or more dimensions. Each data point has a timestamp and (optionally) a unit of measure. Metrics only exist in the region in which they are created.
•	A namespace is a container for CloudWatch metrics. Metrics in different namespaces are isolated from each other, so that metrics from different applications are not mistakenly aggregated into the same statics. The namespaces use the naming convention AWS/<service> for example EC2 uses AWS/EC2 namespace.
•	A dimension is a name-value pair that uniquely identifies a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. Every metric has specific characteristics that describe it, and you can think of dimensions as categories for those characteristics. Dimensions help you design a structure for your statistics plan. You can use dimensions to filter the results that CloudWatch returns. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric. You can think of dimensions as categories for properties
•	A period is the length of time associated with a specific CloudWatch statistic. Periods are defined in number of seconds. You can adjust how the data is aggregated by changing the length of the period. Periods can be as shorts as 1 second to 1 day (86,400 seconds)
Standard and custom metrics 
Standard Metrics:
•	Standard is grouped by service name
•	Display graphically so selected metrics can be compared
•	Metric cannot be deleted but they automatically expire after 15 months if no new service has published to them
•	Reachable through CLI and APIs

Custom Metrics:
•	Groups by user-defined namespace
•	Publish to CloudWatch using CLI, API or CloudWatch Agent
CloudWatch Alarms have three states: OK, Alarm and Insufficient Data 
Alarm state does not always constitute an emergency a restart might cause an alarm because the system is not in a steady state (false positive) 

•	By default EC2 instances only report every 5 minutes (free tier) if you pay you can get up to 1 minute

•	Amazon Cloud Watch alarms are issued in near real-time in response to changes
•	Amazon cloud watch events can be set to automatically trigger based on rate expressions
•	A dimension is a name/value pair that is used for metric identification, and can assist with the design structure for a statistics plan, A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 30 dimensions to a metric.
•	Amazon Simple storage server (S3) Can be used with AWS CloudTrail to store event logs
•	AWS CloudTrail allows an Admin to determine for a given request made to AWS config: 
Who Made the Request 
Source IP address of the request
Time of the Request
Type of the request
•	Custom metrics is a feature of amazon CloudWatch that would you use to publish a statistic on service memory usage for an HTTP server running on an Amazon EC2 instance
•	An Amazon CloudWatch event indicates a change in resource in your AWS environment
•	Possible states of an Amazon CloudWatch are Alarm, Insufficient Data, and OK
•	AWS Config can provide a list of all AWS resources used by an account
•	AWS CloudWatch alarms are sent when a metric value changes
