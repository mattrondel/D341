Lamda and event bridge question whats the answer?

eventbridge 11
what does eventbridge create to route events to targets?

az aurora
read replica?
data reduntancy

#16
classic load balancers - distrubutes traffic across muliple EC2 instances in muliple AZs , operates at request and connection levels
Cross zone load balancers - 
Gateway load balancer - layer 3 of osi model, mainly for network products like NGFW WAF IDS and IPS
Application Load balancer - works at layer 7 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html

different types of load balancers, gateway, classic, internet facing and cross zone
gateway was the answer used, but what is internet-facing
what are charateristics of load balencers like what requires using more than one AZ?
Application:
With an Application Load Balancer however, it is a requirement that you enable at least two or more Availability Zones. This configuration helps ensure that the load balancer can continue to route traffic. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

#18
elastic load balancers and percentages
with application load balancers cross zone is always enabled at the load balancer level
put 12% and 7% as this seems most realistic as A has more clients
I think this is meant to be a trick question as its drawn out its equal on all
"cross zone load balancing distribute load balancing distributes load evently across all registered instances in all AZ's"

#19
SIP and load balancers
becuase the question neames a port number and UPD it makes me think its network , but sip is also an application, choose the network one

#20
restorable times for Distruted relationable data store services
CLI vs Management console
-this is a case of "do you know the command if you saw it" in reality comparing it to the others its the most logical choice
Aws cli describe-db-instances 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html

#21
S3 objects
becuase the question is moving things this is considered a trasaction, other options dont make sense
define when objects are moved from one store class to another
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html
transition actions
becuase its transtioning

#22
info is needed for cross-region replication aws
"Requirements for replication"
seriouly source and destination all other dont make any sense
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html

# 23
effects of converting an image to ebs backed ami
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html
table below "Storage for the root device"
btw its faster eg shorter boot time, no mention of encryption
other part to this not a a prt of the question
aws what are ebs backed amis?
Backed AMIs is an EBS block volume created from an EBS snapshot
The other AMI type is a instance store backed ami is / was a volume created from a template stored in s3

cloudformation
cloudformation feature used to define a collection of resources grouped as a single set
change set , exports, stack set, policy
what is a change set vs stack set
A stack set lets you create stacks in accounts across regions by using a single cloud formation template
	a stack instance referes to a stack in a target account withing a region is assocated with only one stack set...
	a stack is a collection of resources that you can manage as a single unit, you can CUD a collection of resources by CUD stackss
change set - allows you to preview how a proposed change to a stanck might imact current running resources (think changing a set needs a preview)
stack set - defines all resources in each stack, this allows you to do this across regions using one template
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html
"AWS CloudFormation StackSets"
there are two metthods ofor updating stacks: direct update ( i think this means stack set) or creating and executing change sets
change sets allow you to preview while 
Also when you delete all resources in a single stack it insures all resources are terminated and is most efficent way to clean up

Blue green deployments for code deploy
first off codedeploy automates code deployments to any instances such as on-prem or ec2
blue green means 
-choices are:
all-at-once
create services
Linear - 
canary
what all of these mean:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html
there are thesee ways traffic can shift on blue-green:
	canary - traffic is shifted in two increments (why 2 I dont know), think of this in "two parts" you set the minutes between it
	linear - done in equal increments with equal number of minutes between each increment
	all-at-once - traffic is shifted from original task set to updated all at one (thus the name)

MORE BLUE/GREEN
"original task to the updated task at a single point in time"
this sounds like taking it all at once from origninal to the updated

question 27
cloudformation
cleaning up cloudformation applications with minimal effort and insure all resources are terminated
options are (lets define them)
	Delete all the resources as a single stack 
	review the stack and delete each resource 
	batch the resource and terminate stack
	manage the resources using system manager
I think just delete all resources as a single stack 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html
maybe not - During deletion, CloudFormation deletes the stack but doesn't delete the retained resources
I'm leaning more towards
	review the stack and delete each resource 

what can you use to duplicate an environment using IAC?
start with what of these are IAC products
cloudformation -  this is the only IAC aaplication
cloudwatch is not it its monitoring like solarwinds
cloudfront is content delivery
clouldtrail is an audit trail like logs 

question 29
elastic beanstalk
what step is used to activate the application new verison after deployment to keep it available
start with what are these things its asking (like what do these mean?)
	rebuild environment URLs
	compose envirnment
	swap environment URL
	clone environment
	
rebuild environment URLs - "To rebuild a running environment (console)" this sounds a lot like it went down
compose envirnment - this retuned docker stuff, like docker compose
swap environment URL - this sounds most likley as it sounds like a dns backend switch over <-- correct
Clone environment - 

this also returned the blue green words again
what is blue environment and what is green

number 30
patch automation for ec2
	for shits and giggle what are these sservices:
	audit manager
	cloudwatch 
	system manager <--- patching happens here
	cloudformation
due to lack of time left I hunted down the correct answer
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager.html
"Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, automates the process of patching managed nodes"

#31
scedule patching for servers
maint windows <- 
operational insights
metadata inventory
parameter store
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-maintenance.html
"define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your nodes such as patching an operating system"

#32
defining instances for systems manager to apply updates
appconfig is a part of systems manager that .. I dont know but does not involve patching stuff
AWS Systems Manager Explorer - looks like solarwinds but does not do patch stuff but Systems Manager Patch Manager show Data displayed in Explorer includes a count of noncompliant and critical noncompliant nodes.
"Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, as well as a list of approved and rejected patches."
https://mng.workshop.aws/ssm/capability_hands-on_labs/patchmanager.html
Me thnks its patch group
" patch group is an optional method to organize instances for patching." (same url above
think of it as a group of systems to be patched

#33
Partnet event bus - 3rd partie software is considered partner

* when you review quesions the goal it to be able to recognoise what is definitly not correct *

#34
Policy to use to ensure MFA is used on Read objects in S3
Bucket policy <--
Identiy policy
password policy
session policy
Bucket policies set access to s3 buckets with and without MFA

#35
which IAM policy is applied directly to a user to control the users permission?
Resource based policy
Identity based <- permission like what can this person do?, your identity defines your permissions like admin, general, network Admin
password policy
session policy

identity policy - these are attached to an IAM user group or role, they specifiy what the identity can do eg permissions
session policy - policies that you pass as a paramneter when you programatically create a temp session for role or federated user
password policy - this is simply a password policy like how many charters sybols etc
Resource policy - specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can preform on it

#36
What solution send an alert whn usage charges exceed a threshold? (pick 2 MOFO)
Billing dashboard
Budgets
Cloudwatch
Cost explorer

	google:"what can send alerts when charges exceed a threshold?" or "what does budgets do in aws"
	Billing dashboard - could not find that dashboard can do alarms
	Budgets - "lets you set custom cost and usage budgets that alert you when your budget thresholds are exceeded (or forcastged to exceed)
	Cloudwatch - cloudwatch can do this "by using Cloudwatch you can better monitor your estimated aws charges. "cloudwatch alarms is a feature of cloudwatch called metric alarm"
	Cost explorer - "lets you visualize, understand and manage your aws costs and usage over a daily or monlty graularity


#37
Which solution is used to create multiple AWS accounts and to share instance reservations and cost savings across the accounts?
Budgets - tracks your costs, usage, and coverage with custom budgets
Organizations - "lets you creat enew aws accounts at no additional charge"
Control tower - automated the creation of a landing zone with best practices blueprints 
Guarduty - a threat detection service

#38
Which solution should be used to provide access to a dedicated encryption device? 
CloudHSM - HSM is a device

#39
Which type of master key is used to create a single key that can be used to encrypt data? 
synetric key - used to decript and decrypt data

#40
Which solution rotates Amazon RDS database credentials automatically?
Secrets manager does what - enables you to easily rotate manage and retreave database credentials, api keys and other seccrets throughout thier life cycle
