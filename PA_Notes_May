* when you review quesions the goal it to be able to recognoise what is definitly not correct *

EC2 / SNS? SQS
lambda eventbridge cron
elastic load balencers 11

---------------------------

Lamda and event bridge question whats the answer?

eventbridge 11
what does eventbridge create to route events to targets?

az aurora
read replica?
data reduntancy


different types of load balancers, gateway, classic, internet facing and cross zone
gateway was the answer used, but what is internet-facing
what are charateristics of load balencers like what requires using more than one AZ?
Application:
With an Application Load Balancer however, it is a requirement that you enable at least two or more Availability Zones. This configuration helps ensure that the load balancer can continue to route traffic. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

elastic load balancers and percentages
with application load balancers cross zone is always enabled at the load balancer level
put 12% and 7% as this seems most realistic as A has more clients

SIP and load balancers
becuase the question neames a port number and UPD it makes me think its network , but sip is also an application, choose the network one

restorable times for Distruted relationable data store services
CLI vs Management console
Aws cli describe-db-instances 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html

S3 objects
define when objects are moved from one store class to another
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html
transition actions
becuase its transtioning

info is needed for cross-region replication aws
"Requirements for replication"
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html

question 23
effects of converting an image to ebs backed ami
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html
table below "Storage for the root device"
btw its faster eg shorter boot time, no mention of encryption
other part to this not a a prt of the question
aws what are ebs backed amis?
Backed AMIs is an EBS block volume created from an EBS snapshot
The other AMI type is a instance store backed ami is / was a volume created from a template stored in s3

cloudformation
cloudformation feature used to define a collection of resources grouped as a single set
change set , exports, stack set, policy
what is a change set vs stack set
change set - allows you to preview how a proposed change to a stanck might imact current running roesources
stack set - defines all resources in each stack, this allows you to do this across regions using one template
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html
"AWS CloudFormation StackSets"
there are two metthods ofor updating stacks: direct update ( i think this means stack set) or creating and executing change sets
change sets allow you to preview while 

Blue green deployments for codedeply
first off codedeploy automates code deployments to any instances such as on-prem or ec2
blue green means 
-choices are:
all-at-once
create services
Linear - 
canary
what all of these mean:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html
there are thesee ways traffic can shift on blue-green:

	canary - traffic is shifted in two increments (why 2 I dont know), think of this in "two parts" you set the minutes between it
	linear - done in equal increments with equal number of minutes between each increment
	all-at-once - traffic is shifted from original task set to updated all at one (thus the name)

MORE BLUE/GREEN
"original task to the updated task at a single point in time"
this sounds like taking it all at once from origninal to the updated

question 27
cloudformation
cleaning up cloudformation applications with minimal effort and insure all resources are terminated
options are (lets define them)
	Delete all the resources as a single stack 
	review the stack and delete each resource 
	batch the resource and terminate stack
	manage the resources using system manager
I think just delete all resources as a single stack 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html
maybe not - During deletion, CloudFormation deletes the stack but doesn't delete the retained resources
I'm leaning more towards
	review the stack and delete each resource 

what can you use to duplicate an environment using IAC?
start with what of these are IAC products
cloud formation - 
cloudwatch is not its monitoring like solarwinds
cloudfront is content delivery
clouldtrail is an audit trail like logs 

question 29
elastic beanstalk
what step is used to activate the application new verison after deployment to keep it available
start with what are these things its asking (like what do these mean?)
	rebuild environment URLs
	compose envirnment
	swap environment URL
	clone environment
	
rebuild environment URLs - "To rebuild a running environment (console)" this sounds a lot like it went down
compose envirnment - this retuned docker stuff
swap environment URL - this sounds most likley as it sounds like a dns backend switch over


this also returned the blue green words again
what is blue environment and what is green
