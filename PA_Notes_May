cloud watch 11111111
EC2 / SNS? SQS
lambda eventbridge cron
elastic load balencers 11

---------------------------

1
custom metric for cloudwatch is what?
memory or CPU usage?
I picked memory

2
cloudwatch alarm for high mem usage for server running on ec2
create custom metric

3
Cloudwatch alarm for words  error and critical
ERROR and critical

4
needs to count the number of messages containing error
metric filter
fyi syntetic canary are scripts tohat monitor endpoints and api from the outside-in

5
cloudwatch feature for on-prem system level memtrics
custom dashboards
fyi xray trace - aws xray is a tool for developers to conduct preformace analysis


6
reporting frequency on cloudwatch dashboards
60 seconds 
every minute if deytailed is on or 5 minutes by default

7
when 8 ec2 instances crash what service sould send the the alarms to
SNS - notification

8
what cloudwatch feature detects changes in an aws envirnment?
events?

9
what expression should be used to trigger a lamda function from a cloudwatch eventbridgee at 8am on weekdays?
cron 0 8 * * Mon-Fri *
its not 0 8 1 becuase i dont THINK THAT i is used foe anything that describes the question
rate isnt specific for the the need in queston

10
what service works with lamda to trigger corrective action if the health of an AWS service is failing 
I think its eventbridge , trusted doesnt sound right, systems manager is for patching, cloudtrail is audit trail
Im thinks events trigger alarms

11
how does eventbridge provide a direct message to subcribers in response to a status change in an instances health?
sns sends messages, went with that 

Lamda and event bridge question whats the answer?

12
what does eventbridge create to route events to targets?
logs - this sounds like an after the fact
service - 
API - 
Rules - sounds most like it 

13
az aurora question in us-east-1 and has requirements
	latency should be minimal
	impact of reporting should be minimized
	lag of data used for reporting should be minimized

not muli AZ this would make it slower not faster
same with mulit region this makes slower
going with read replica in same subnet as this is the same network

14
auroa deployment as a data store for ec2 in us-east-1 (again) needs the following requirements
	data will remain accessable during single data center failure
	impact of read only workloads on write workloads will be reduced
	latency of read operations will be minimized

going wilh replicaa in another Availaviliy zone or the same region
AZ is fancy wod for data center

15
vericle expansion means what
change instace type


#16
classic load balancers - distrubutes traffic across muliple EC2 instances in muliple AZs , operates at request and connection levels
Cross zone load balancers - 
Gateway load balancer - layer 3 of osi model, mainly for network products like NGFW WAF IDS and IPS
Application Load balancer - works at layer 7 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html

different types of load balancers, gateway, classic, internet facing and cross zone
gateway was the answer used, but what is internet-facing

17
what elastic load balencer requires using more than one availabilty zone?
what are charateristics of load balencers like what requires using more than one AZ?
Application:
With an Application Load Balancer however, it is a requirement that you enable at least two or more Availability Zones. This configuration helps ensure that the load balancer can continue to route traffic. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

#18
elastic load balancers and percentages
with application load balancers cross zone is always enabled at the load balancer level
put 12% and 7% as this seems most realistic as A has more clients
I think this is meant to be a trick question as its drawn out its equal on all
"cross zone load balancing distribute load balancing distributes load evently across all registered instances in all AZ's"

#19
VOIP, SIP and load balancers
becuase the question neames a port number and UPD it makes me think its network , but sip is also an application, choose the network one becuase of the port question


#20
restorable times for Distruted relationable data store services
CLI vs Management console
-this is a case of "do you know the command if you saw it" in reality comparing it to the others its the most logical choice
Aws cli describe-db-instances 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PIT.html

#21
S3 objects
becuase the question is moving things this is considered a transaction, other options dont make sense
define when objects are moved from one store class to another
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/lifecycle-transition-general-considerations.html
transition actions
becuase its transtioning

#22
info is needed for cross-region replication aws
"Requirements for replication"
seriouly source and destination all other dont make any sense
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/replication.html

# 23
effects of converting an image to ebs backed ami
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html
table below "Storage for the root device"
btw its faster eg shorter boot time, no mention of encryption
other part to this not a part of the question
aws what are ebs backed amis?
Backed AMIs is an EBS block volume created from an EBS snapshot
The other AMI type is a instance store backed ami is / was a volume created from a template stored in s3

24
cloudformation
cloudformation feature used to define a collection of resources grouped as a single set
change set , exports, stack set, policy
what is a change set vs stack set
A stack set lets you create stacks in accounts across regions by using a single cloud formation template
	a stack instance referes to a stack in a target account withing a region is assocated with only one stack set...
	a stack is a collection of resources that you can manage as a single unit, you can CUD a collection of resources by CUD stackss
change set - allows you to preview how a proposed change to a stanck might imact current running resources (think changing a set needs a preview)
stack set - defines all resources in each stack, this allows you to do this across regions using one template
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-concepts.html
"AWS CloudFormation StackSets"
there are two metthods ofor updating stacks: direct update ( i think this means stack set) or creating and executing change sets
change sets allow you to preview while 
Also when you delete all resources in a single stack it insures all resources are terminated and is most efficent way to clean up
change set = "previewing changes"

25
Blue green deployments for code deploy
first off codedeploy automates code deployments to any instances such as on-prem or ec2
blue green means 
-choices are:
	all-at-once
	create services
	Linear - 
	canary
what all of these mean:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/deployment-type-bluegreen.html
there are these ways traffic can shift on blue-green:
	canary - traffic is shifted in two increments (why 2 I dont know), think of this in "two parts" you set the minutes between it
	linear - done in equal increments with equal number of minutes between each increment
	all-at-once - traffic is shifted from original task set to updated all at one (thus the name)

26
MORE BLUE/GREEN
"original task to the updated task at a single point in time"
this sounds like taking it all-at-once from origninal to the updated

27
cloudformation
cleaning up cloudformation applications with minimal effort and insure all resources are terminated
options are (lets define them)
	Delete all the resources as a single stack 
	Review the stack and delete each resource 
	batch the resource and terminate stack
	manage the resources using system manager
I think just delete all resources as a single stack 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html
maybe not - During deletion, CloudFormation deletes the stack but doesn't delete the retained resources
I'm leaning more towards
	review the stack and delete each resource 

28
what can you use to duplicate an environment using IAC?
start with what of these are IAC products
	cloudformation -  this is the only IAC aaplication
	cloudwatch - is not it its monitoring like solarwinds
	cloudfront - is content delivery like steaming technology 
	clouldtrail - is an audit trail like logs 

29
elastic beanstalk
what step is used to activate the application new verison after deployment to keep it available
start with what are these things its asking (like what do these mean?)
	rebuild environment URLs
	compose environment
	swap environment URL
	clone environment
	
rebuild environment URLs - "To rebuild a running environment (console)" this sounds a lot like it went down
compose environment - this retuned docker stuff, like docker compose
swap environment URL - this sounds most likley as it sounds like a dns backend switch over <-- correct
Clone environment - 

#30
patch automation for ec2
	for shits and giggle what are these services:
	audit manager
	cloudwatch 
	system manager <--- patching happens here
	cloudformation - for IAC building new stuff
due to lack of time left I hunted down the correct answer
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/patch-manager.html
"Patch Manager, a capability of AWS Systems Manager, automates the process of patching managed nodes"

#31
scedule patching for servers
maint windows <- 
operational insights
metadata inventory
parameter store
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-maintenance.html
"define a schedule for when to perform potentially disruptive actions on your nodes such as patching an operating system"

#32
what can be used to define instances for systems manager to apply updates
AppConfig - is a part of systems manager that .. I dont know but does not involve patching stuff
Explorer - looks like solarwinds but does not do patch stuff but Systems Manager Patch Manager show Data displayed in Explorer includes a count of noncompliant and critical noncompliant nodes.
"Patch Manager uses patch baselines, which include rules for auto-approving patches within days of their release, as well as a list of approved and rejected patches."
https://mng.workshop.aws/ssm/capability_hands-on_labs/patchmanager.html
Me thnks its patch group
" patch group is an optional method to organize instances for patching." (same url above
think of it as a group of systems to be patched
"take a group of systems and define them for patching"

33
systems manager documents in response to a trigger generated crap in zendesk
"partner" meaning 3rd party

#34
Policy to use to ensure MFA is used on Read objects in S3
Bucket policy <--
Identiy policy
password policy
session policy
Bucket policies set access to s3 buckets with and without MFA

#35
which IAM policy is applied directly to a user to control the users permission?
Resource based policy
Identity based <- permission like what can this person do?, your identity defines your permissions like admin, general, network Admin
password policy
session policy

identity policy - these are attached to an IAM user group or role, they specifiy what the identity can do eg permissions
session policy - policies that you pass as a paramneter when you programatically create a temp session for role or federated user
password policy - this is simply a password policy like how many charters sybols etc
Resource policy - specify who has access to the resource and what actions they can preform on it

#36
What solution send an alert whn usage charges exceed a threshold? (pick 2 MOFO)
Billing dashboard
Budgets
Cloudwatch
Cost explorer

	google:"what can send alerts when charges exceed a threshold?" or "what does budgets do in aws"
	Billing dashboard - could not find that dashboard can do alarms
	Budgets - "lets you set custom cost and usage budgets that alert you when your budget thresholds are exceeded (or forcastged to exceed)
	Cloudwatch - cloudwatch can do this "by using Cloudwatch you can better monitor your estimated aws charges. "cloudwatch alarms is a feature of cloudwatch called metric alarm"
	Cost explorer - "lets you visualize, understand and manage your aws costs and usage over a daily or monlty graularity

#37
Which solution is used to create multiple AWS accounts and to share instance reservations and cost savings across the accounts?
Budgets - tracks your costs, usage, and coverage with custom budgets
Organizations - "lets you creat new aws accounts at no additional charge"
Control tower - automated the creation of a landing zone with best practices blueprints 
Guarduty - a threat detection service

#38
Which solution should be used to provide access to a dedicated encryption device? 
CloudHSM - HSM is a device

#39
Which type of master key is used to create a single key that can be used to encrypt data? 
synetric key - used to decript and decrypt data

#40
Which solution rotates Amazon RDS database credentials automatically?
Secrets manager does what - enables you to easily rotate manage and retreave database credentials, api keys and other seccrets throughout thier life cycle

34 
Read objcets policies s3 
MFA on what ?
I think this a case of whats the best answer 
password policy is like what used on stigs
identity policy is for __?
bucket is well duh S3session policy sounds like the login session, why would any of these be for mfa read 

35
IAM policy to control the users permissions
well users are identity like who is the person or resource, also a case of what sounds most right

36
2 solutions that send alerts when usage charges excced a threshold?
can these send alerts?
cost exploerer - this is an overtime deal not in real time it sounds like
billing dashboard - i dont think it does alerts/alarms
cloudwatch - can monitor estimated charges and can send alerts
budgets - I think it can send alerts/alarms
ITS
Budgets and CloudWatch

37
solution to create mulitple aws accoutns and share instances and cost savings
organizations

38
HSM

39
type of master key is used to create a singl key to encrtpt data 
other name for single key encryption is symmetric

40
secrets manager roates keys?

41
what nativlyey supports versioning of RDS creds?
key management service? AWS KMS (think of it as aws's last pass or keepass service - nope
!!! its Secrets Manager !!!

42
VPC Questions.... damn it!
sounds like you need to add a rule but is it for ACL oe security group 
difference between security group and acl
	Security group is the Firewall of ec2 instances
	Network ACL is the Firewall of VPC subnets
"The http traffic needs to be permitted to the ec2 instance from other ec2 instances on the same subnet"
SG = EC2
ACL or NACL = VPC
going with add a rule to the subnets network acl - I think this because it needs other ec2s on the same subnet, "to the instance"
-add a rule to the securty group is the answer not sure why other thatn its the other answer 

43
what solution should be used to allow VPCs to send data to one another in a full mesh configuration
start with what is all of this stuff?
direct connect - on-prem to one or more vpcs, no mention of mesh
global accelerator - improves availablity , no mention of mesh
gateway endpoint - this connects aws services without hitting the public internet
transit gateway - connects VPCs to on-prem through a central hub, mentions it replicates a full mesh toplogy
would love to know the answer, going with transit gateway, think transit like trains like in thomas the tank engine or polar express

44
what two are correct statements about securty groups?
stateful meaning it can go out and come back
thinking on the cisco stuff that firewall have implict deny I picked secuirty groups only support allow rules

45
rule for ddos attack prevention by determining the frequesncy of requests 
i thinking rate based, all other dont make sense to pick

46
route 53 question based on users location
weighted - 
geolocation - based on the geograpic location of your users, meaning the lcoation that dns quirieres originate from (location of users)
geoproxmity - location of the resources 
latency - measurements preformed over a period of time
geoproxmity vs geolocation - geolocation based on location of users, geoproxy when you want to route based on location of resources, think of a proxy server and where it is, thats geoproxy

47
allowing access to static s3 websites though cloudfront
global accelerator - helps improve availabilty preformace and securty of public applications
origin access identity - (OAC) - used for sharing private content via cloudfront
sheild advanced - 
security group - 
going with OAC

48
protocol polices supported by cloudfront
https adn redirect to https

49
vpc subnet question ... damn it
!!!!skipping for later

50
what can be used to store vpc flow logs
accounding to my reasearch its : s3, coudwatch logs, and kinesis data firehouse

51
VPC flow log interpitation
from 203.xxxx source port of 10687 has been denied

52
what service is used to query vpc flow logs for analysis
athena can querey vpc flow logs
redshift is used for large data warehousing
dynamo db is a nosql db
elasticasce is memory cacing aritecture

53
cloud front access logs are store in simple storage service (s3) 

54
tags question
defines tags for cost allocation these do not appear on the billing report
what should be used to ensure tags appear on the report?
Add prefix "cost" to the tag name or activate the tags for the report?
going with activate tags
correct

55
what gerates billing alarms ?
going with cloudwatch

56
managing a sql server farm by manually deploying compute instances
what can be used to optimizate the management cost of the solution?
AWS efs is - a file storage service for use with compute
documentdb - managed propritary nosql db service
RDS - "relational database service " makes it easier to set up operate and scale a relational database , 
damn sounds like RDS or EFS might work , b ut im going with RDS as it sound smor elike it fits the need better

57
EC2 with EBS this take a long time to boot what would help speed it up ?
	ec2 backup - 
	ec2 instance store - acts as a physcical hard drive, data persists in the lifetimne of the instace
	ec2 hibernate - like windows hibernate boots up faster using in ebs <--- most likley
	ec2 reserved instance - 

58
instace has been provisooned using provisioned IOPS, what should be done to troubleshoot performace of the instace
Volumetotalreadtime - 
volumequeuelength is the number of pending I/O requests for a device
volumetotalwritetime - 
volumethroughputpercentage - 
all options saw stuff about "average queue lenth" but only one has volumequeuelength as an optional

59
what solution should be used to optimizae the performace of s3 by using edge locations
glacer select - allows you to preform filterting directly against a glacer object using sql statements
Intelligent-Tiering - is cloud strage class that gives cost savings when data access paterns change
mulipart uploads - zippyshare for uploads
transfer acceration - uses edge locations for transfere of files

60 - maximum number of partitions that can be created in a partition placement group withi a single availabilty zone
A partition placement group supports a maximum of seven partitions per Availability Zone.
