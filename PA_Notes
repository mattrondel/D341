“An administrator needs to set up an Amazon CloudWatch alarm in response to high memory utilization by a web server running on an EC2 instance.
 
What must be done as part of setting up an alarm?”
Configure a custom metric 
Why this is the answer?
EC2 instances don’t natively report on memory unless you install the agent and have CloudWatch setup with Configure a custom metric
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/mon-scripts.html

An administrator needs to create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm. The alarm should be triggered only when log entries of a web server running on an EC2 instance contain both the "ERROR" and the "Critical" strings.
 
Which filter should be used to define a custom metric that will trigger the alarm?
ERROR Critical
Why this is correct?
Need to find examples but the other options have odd characters between the words or hypen which isn’t right
---
An engineer needs to count the number of messages containing the term ERROR.
 
Which CloudWatch feature should be used?
Answer Metric filter
Why is this correct another case or all the other are wrong
--- 
Which CloudWatch feature supports on-premises system-level metrics?
Answer Custom dashboards 
Why this is correct: on-prem means you need something custom
--- 
Which reporting frequency do CloudWatch dashboards use with detailed instance monitoring?
60 seconds (1 minute mentioned in this doc)

Which CloudWatch feature is used to detect state changes in an AWS environment?  
CloudWatch the verb is uses is Events think Event Watch
--- 
Which expression should be used to trigger a Lambda function from a CloudWatch EventBridge event at 8:00 a.m. on weekdays?
Cron is time short for Cronological
Correct answer Cron(0 8 * * MON-FRI)

Which service works with Lambda to trigger corrective action if the health of an AWS service is failing?
Answer EventBridge
Why?
I think of Events leading to corrective action
--- 
How does EventBridge provide a direct message to subscribers in response to a status change in an instance's health?
Answer: SNS notifications 
Why SNS and not Systems report, CloudWatch or logs?
Direct message is the keyword here, SNS is push based, supports email and text too, sns is a pub/sub service “SUBSCRIBERS” is the keyword 
Systems report is too slow? Maybe 
--- 
What does EventBridge create to route events to targets?
Start with what eventbridge is ,a serverless event router aka a serverless event bus. It uses routing rules not logs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrZG1mr6H8I

Configures Network Connectivity - 20%
An Amazon VPC subnet hosts an EC2 instance. The EC2 has the following configuration:
•	It is associated with a single security group containing a single rule.
•	It is configured to only accept SSH traffic from other EC2 instances on the same subnet.
 
The HTTP traffic needs to be permitted to the EC2 instance from other EC2 instances on the same subnet.
 
Answer Add a rule to the security group
Why? Taking a rule away doesn’t help as it only has one rule to start, since your trying to get more than just ssh removing a rule from the subnets acl won’t help either as subnets are layer 3 and https is layer 7
--- 
Which solution should be used to allow VPCs to send data to one another in a full mesh configuration?
Answer transit gateway
Why: transit gateways send data from Vpcs and on prem networks through a central hub
Gateway endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for your VPC. 
Direct connect is a dedicated line installed to your data center to aws instead of a regular commercial line
--- 
Which two statements are correct regarding security groups?
 
Choose 2 answers.
Answer: Stateful and “only support allow rules”
Why: Security group rules enable you to filter traffic based on protocols and port numbers. They are stateful , the allow rules I think I knew from firewall basics but I don’t recall where I found this nor was I able to find this mentioned
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html
--- 
Which type of rule should be used to protect against a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack by determining the frequency of requests?
Answer rate based
Why? This is a case of all other answers are definitely wrong, ddos isn’t just http based and a URI is uniform resource identifier or stuff on the www that start with http: or mailto: - these are simply not of the right part of the osi layer. Also think rate is a frequency adjective.

A company deploys an application to multiple AWS Regions. The company requires a Route 53 routing policy that routes traffic based on a user's Region. The company also needs the ability to control the size of the geographic region for which traffic is routed.
 
Which routing policy should this company use?
Answer: Geoproximity routing policy
Why? This one I admit is tricky since there are two “geo” words but since it asks for users location think the keyword here is proximity.
--- 
Which solution should be used to allow access to S3 static websites only through CloudFront?
Answer: Origin access identity, this a case of all other are wrong and this isn’t the best answer only the most correct
Why? 
Shield advanced is for ddos protection
Global Accelerator isn’t for CloudFront its for deterministic routing independent of dns at edge locations.
Security group sounds correct but its not of the two mentioned in the below url of “CloudFront provides two ways to send authenticated requests to an Amazon S3 origin: origin access control (OAC) and origin access identity (OAI)”
Security groups by definition, controls traffic that is allowed to reach and leave resources but

--- 
Which two protocol policies are supported by CloudFront? Pick 2
https only and redirect to https
Why? There is no http only, if https only was correct then that would negate the redirect choices
