EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable.
Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular
  •	SSM Vs Event Bridge Vs OpsWork Vs Fargate
  SSM – this is AWS Systems Manager, it allows you to safely automate common and repetitive IT operations and management tasks.
  Eventbridge -  EventBridge
  OpsWork – OpsWorks
    Anything that mentions containers with Chef or Puppet is OPSWORK
AWS Opswork is a configuration manager service that helps automate the deployments, configuration and management of infrastructure and application in the cloud. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing infrastructure and applications in the cloud its flexible and automated
Fargate – is a serverless engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers
  Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate

Know how VPC's are connected to onsite network
Site to site VPN – 
Direct connect main use is on-prem to aws cloud 
Transit gateway 
VPN cloudhub
VPC peering


doc: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html
Anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM 
Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out.
Know what VPC endpoints and the purpose.
Know what is used when Geoproximity is implemented whether it's Region/Zone or Lat/long
Know the difference between geolocation and geoproximity
What is AWS Mace Vs Inspector Vs Guard Duty and how they are used
Know cloud formation and the intrinsic functions.
Know cloudwatch metrics and what default metrics are tracked vs which metrics needs the the cloud watch agent. 
EventBridge and cron expression
cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions. 
AWS Athena is for querying S3 objects.
EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines)
CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets
System Manager like a lot especially the automation documents. 
NAT instance vs NAT Gateway.

WGU specific:
Study the PA, every answer, even the wrong answers, and figure out why they're wrong.
Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding 




How they are used, know the difference between geolocation and geoproximity

Ok so I was able to pass this one on Friday here are my thoughts or some strategies that I found to be extremely useful, 
First off the youtube video found here is extremely useful vital IMO : 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ

Now for the stuff you absolutely need to know - Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular, they will try to 

Trick on this -- the video series does not cover this in detail at all please use this link

Know cloud formation and the intrinsic functions.

Also know cloudwatch metrics and what default metrics are tracked vs which metrics needs the the cloud watch agent. 

Study Strategy ---- Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have 

difficulty understanding I'd recommend watching the youtube video at 2x speed first then go over the WGU materials as much

 of the exam will be based on that --labs are not necessary to pass but they'll def help -- I skipped the labs-- Pay close 

attention to Chapters 7-11 esp Chapters 7 & 11 I've added the cheatsheet from the youtube course Good Luck Everyone


EventBridge and cron expression

Watch the EventBridge sections on the youtube video in the Course Tips

EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable

Research cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions. 
•	Be familiar with cron syntax just in case

Know AWS Athena is for querying S3 objects - 

Tip: Study the PA, every answer, even the wrong answers, and figure out why they're wrong.

Useful stuff:
Stephane Maarek's practice tests on Udemy
AWS SysOps Administrator Associate 2020 (PASS THE EXAM!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ

I would also look over the AWS documentation for things like: EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines), etc.

Many eventbridge questions be family with it

Spend adequate time learning about CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets as well. 
Stacksets info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html


System Manager like a lot especially the automation documents. NAT instance vs NAT Gateway.

Neal Davis 

However do extra study on LAMBDA and RATE/CRON.

EventBridge and how it works, the file formats used and the language. 

if a question mentions volume it talking about EBS, file it referring to EFS. Quite a few questions on cloudwatch, System Mgr, AWS Config and NACL/ALB.

EventBridge is used a lot here. 
-------------------------------------------
Reddit stuff

Watched all of the AWS Academy videos
Did the knowledge checks at the end of each module
Took the Sections tests at the end of each section
Took the little practice test at the end of the material
Took the PA, open-book style. Used it to research concepts or AWS services I was not very familiar with as I went along. If I thought I knew an answer, I'd go ahead and give that question a shot without looking at any material (this is usually how I take PAs)
Took the PA later without help and made 100% (Understandably as I studied the questions awhile taking it)
Read through the Course Chatter. People mentioned that you should know EventBridge well and understand cron expressions. And to be honest, a cron question came up on the OA and I was kind of unsure about the answer because it the syntax didn't really stick with me.
