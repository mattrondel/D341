-EventBrodge-
EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable.

Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular
However do extra study on LAMBDA and RATE/CRON.
EventBridge and cron expression
cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions.

SSM Vs Event Bridge Vs OpsWork Vs Fargate
SSM – this is AWS Systems Manager, it allows you to safely automate common and repetitive IT operations and management tasks.
Know the difference between those and how they are used anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM
Think SSM patching

Read through the Course Chatter. People mentioned that you should know EventBridge well and understand cron expressions. And to be honest, a cron question came up on the OA and I was kind of unsure about the answer because it the syntax didn't really stick with me.
EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines)
I would also look over the AWS documentation for things like: EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines), etc.
Watch the EventBridge sections on the youtube video in the Course Tips
EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable
Many eventbridge questions be family with it
EventBridge and how it works, the file formats used and the language. 
EventBridge is used a lot here.

CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets

-OpsWorks-
OpsWorks – contianers with chef or puppet
Anything that mentions containers with Chef or Puppet is OPSWORK
Opsworks is a configuration manager service that helps automate the deployments, configuration and management of infrastructure and application in the cloud. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing infrastructure and applications in the cloud it’s flexible and automated

SSM Vs Event Bridge Vs OpsWork Vs Fargate
-Fargate-
Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate
Fargate – is a serverless engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers
Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate
Fargate think container manager

Know how VPC's are connected to onsite network
Site to site VPN - 
Direct connect main use is on-prem to aws cloud 
Transit gateway 
VPN cloudhub
VPC peering
Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out.
Transit gateway - 
Direct Connect - 
Site-to-site VPN - 
 Know what are VPC endpoints and the purpose

-SSM Systems manager-
System Manager like a lot especially the automation documents.
Anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM
AWS SSM patch manager automates the process of patching managed nodes with updates
 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html
Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out.
Know what VPC endpoints and the purpose.
Know what is used when Geoproximity is implemented whether it's Region/Zone or Lat/long
Know the difference between geolocation and geoproximity
What is AWS Mace Vs Inspector Vs Guard Duty and how they are used
Know cloud formation and the intrinsic functions.
Know cloudwatch metrics and what default metrics are tracked vs which metrics needs the cloud watch agent. 
Why you would need the cloudwatch agent: 
Used on both on-prem (not managed by aws) and aws servers it allows you to collect custom metrics like if you have specific application-level metrics you want to monitor
To install the agent package from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), using AWS Systems Manager, AWS CloudFormation, or by installing it manually using the command line.

NAT instance vs NAT Gateway.
WGU specific:
Study the PA, every answer, even the wrong answers, and figure out why they're wrong.
Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding 
Ok so I was able to pass this one on Friday here are my thoughts or some strategies that I found to be extremely useful, 

-Cron and Rate-
Now for the stuff you absolutely need to know - Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular, they will try to trick on this -- the video series does not cover this in detail at all please use this link 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html 

SSM Vs Event Bridge Vs OpsWork Vs Fargate 
SSM - systems manager think patching or patch management
EventBridge
OpsWorks
Fargate

Know how VPC's are connected to onsite networks very IMPORTANT! Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out. 
Study Strategy ---- Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding I'd recommend watching the youtube video at 2x speed first then go over the WGU materials as much of the exam will be based on that --labs are not necessary to pass but they'll def help -- I skipped the labs-- Pay close attention to Chapters 7-11 esp Chapters 7 & 11 I've added the cheatsheet from the youtube course
Research cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions. 
Be familiar with cron syntax just in case
AWS Athena is for querying S3 objects – 
Tip: Study the PA, every answer, even the wrong answers, and figure out why they're wrong.
Useful stuff:
Stephane Maarek's practice tests on Udemy
First off the youtube video found here is extremely useful vital IMO :
AWS SysOps Administrator Associate 2020 (PASS THE EXAM!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ

Spend adequate time learning about CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets as well. 
Stacksets info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html

System Manager like a lot especially the automation documents. 

If a question mentions volume it talking about EBS
File it referring to EFS
Quite a few questions on CloudWatch, System Mgr, AWS Config and NACL/ALB.

-------------------------------------------
Reddit stuff

Watch all of the AWS Academy videos
Do the knowledge checks at the end of each module
Take the Sections tests at the end of each section
Take the little practice test at the end of the material
Take the PA, open-book style. Used it to research concepts or AWS services I was not very familiar with as I went along. If I thought I knew an answer, I'd go ahead and give that question a shot without looking at any material (this is usually how I take PAs)
Take the PA later without help and made 100% (Understandably as I studied the questions awhile taking it)

Now for the stuff you absolutely need to know - Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular, they will try to trick on this -- the video series does not cover this in detail at all please use this link https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html
AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet
