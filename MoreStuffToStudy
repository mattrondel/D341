SSM Vs EventBridge Vs OpsWork Vs Fargate

-SSM Systems manager-
SSM – this is AWS Systems Manager, it allows you to safely automate common and repetitive IT operations and management tasks.
SSM - systems manager think patching or patch management
Know the difference between those and how they are used anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM
Think SSM patching
System Manager like a lot especially the automation documents.

Also known as AWS Simple services manager (SSM)
Think patching is simple like simple services 
SSM is an umbrella of services used to automate the management of virtual machines 
Anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM
AWS SSM patch manager automates the process of patching managed nodes with updates
 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html
Big two are automation and run command
SSM patch manager is just for that, patches can be installed on the regular by scheduling patches to run as a systems manager maintenance window task
2 things you need for ssm to work the SSM agent (if you’re not already using an AWS backed image) and the SSM AWS Managed policy attached your IAM role (of AmazonSSMMangedCore)
In order to send custom application logs running on ec2 instances you need to install the SSM CloudWatch agent

-EventBridge AKA CloudWatch-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ&t=3796s
EventBridge is a serverless account wide or organization event bus
Many AWS services emit event data, but for services that do not you can turn on cloud trail
EventBridge was formally called CloudWatch events
EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable.
Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular
However do extra study on LAMBDA and RATE/CRON.
EventBridge and cron expression
cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions.
Read through the Course Chatter. People mentioned that you should know EventBridge well and understand cron expressions. And to be honest, a cron question came up on the OA and I was kind of unsure about the answer because it the syntax didn't really stick with me.
I would also look over the AWS documentation for things like: EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines), etc.
Watch the EventBridge sections on the YouTube video in the Course Tips
EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable
Why you would need the CloudWatch agent: 
Used on both on-prem (not managed by aws) and aws servers it allows you to collect custom metrics like if you have specific application-level metrics you want to monitor
To install the agent package from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), using AWS Systems Manager, AWS CloudFormation, or by installing it manually using the command line.
Memory utilization (Am I running out of memory?)
Disk space utilization (am I running out of disk space?)

Know CloudWatch metrics and what default metrics are tracked vs which metrics needs the cloud watch agent.

Many EventBridge questions be family with it
EventBridge and how it works, the file formats used and the language. 
EventBridge is used a lot here. 
EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines)

-OpsWorks-

or cheatsheet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ&t=8088s
OpsWorks is a config management service for the following:


OpsWorks – containers with chef or puppet
Think DevOps OpsWorks, chef puppet etc
AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet
Anything that mentions containers with Chef or Puppet is OPSWORK
OpsWorks is a configuration manager service that helps automate the deployments, configuration and management of infrastructure and application in the cloud. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing infrastructure and applications in the cloud it’s flexible and automated

-Fargate-
Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate
Fargate – is a server less engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers
Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate
Fargate think container manager

-CloudFormation-

Know cloud formation and the intrinsic functions.
When being asked to automate provisioning of resources or IaC think CloudFormation
When CloudFormation encounters and error it will rollback with ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS
CloudFormation templates larger than 0.05 mb (51,200 bytes) need to be added via s3 buckets
Nested stacks helps you break up CloudFormation templates into smaller reusable templates that can be composed into larger templates
At least one resource under resources must be defined for a CloudFormation template to be valid
CloudFormation Template sections
•	Metadata – extra information about your template
•	Description – a description of what the template is supposed to do
•	Parameters – is how you get user inputs into templates (think like programming)
•	Transforms – Applies macros (like applying a mod which change the anatomy to be custom)
•	Outputs – are values you can use to import into other stacks
•	Mappings – maps keys to values, just like a lookup table
•	Resources -defines the resources you want to provision, at least one resource is required
•	Conditions – are whether resources are created or properties are assigned

Stack Updates can be performed two different ways
•	Direct updates – you directly update the stack, submit changes and CloudFormation deploys them
•	Executing change sets – you can preview the changes to CloudFormation will make to your stack and you decide if you want to apply those changes

Serverless application model (SAM) is an extension of CloudFormation that lets you define serverless applications 
Spend adequate time learning about CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stack sets as well. 
CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets

VPCs are region specific as they do not span regions
You can create 5 VPCs per region
Each region comes with a default VPC
You can have 200 subnets per VPC
Both IPV4 and IPV6 CIDR blocks can be used 
Somethings cost you money like NAT gateway, VPC endpoints, VPN Gateway, Customer gateway
Somethings are free like VPCs, route tables, NACLs, Internet gateways, security groups and subnets and VPC peering
Know how VPC's are connected to onsite networks very IMPORTANT! 
VPC peering allows you to connect one VPC with another over a direct network route using private IP addresses. Peered instances behave just like they are on the same network 
Internet gateway (IGW) allows your VPC to access the internet (duh)
You can connect VPCs across same or different aws accounts and regions
There is no transitive peering meaning you can’t go though one peer to get to another it uses a star configuration 
How do VPCs connect to onsite networks?
What is a Customer gateway –is a physical or virtual appliance that acts as a gateway between a customer's on-premises network and an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
 A customer gateway is a key component in setting up a site-to-site VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection between the customer's on-premises infrastructure and AWS VPC.
Know how VPC's are connected to onsite network
Site to site VPN - 
VPN CloudHub - is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to create a hub-and-spoke network topology to connect multiple on-premises data centers or branch locations to an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) securely. – think Hub as in hub and spoke 
Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out.
Transit gateway - 
Direct Connect - main use is on-prem to aws cloud
Site-to-site VPN - 
NAT instance vs NAT Gateway:
NAT Instance - A NAT instance is a single EC2 instance configured to perform NAT. It can be launched in a public subnet and assigned an Elastic IP address, which will be used as the public IP address for instances in the private subnet to access the internet. NAT instances can be customized with additional software or security configurations, but they require manual configuration and maintenance.
NAT Gateway - NAT Gateway is a managed service provided by AWS. It is a highly available and scalable solution that can support thousands of instances simultaneously. A NAT Gateway is deployed in a public subnet and can be used by instances in one or more private subnets to access the internet. It is automatically scaled up or down based on demand, and AWS manages all aspects of the service, including security updates and maintenance.
NAT Gateway is preferred over NAT instance due to its ease of management, higher scalability, and better availability. However, NAT instance may be a suitable option if customized configurations or more control over the environment is required.
How VPC's are connected to onsite networks:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/network-to-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.html
Know what VPC endpoints and the purpose.
Know the difference between geolocation and geoproximity
Know what is used when Geoproximity is implemented whether it's Region/Zone or Lat/long
Geolocation - Geolocation refers to the process of identifying the location of your users by means of digital information that is available on the internet (for example, their IP addresses.)
Geoproximity - Geoproximity, on the other hand, refers to a specific technique to route traffic to web servers.
What is the difference between geoproximity routing policy and geolocation?
Both Geolocation and Geoproximity routing policies route traffic based on the geographic location of the users and server resources
Geoproximity routing policy additionally allows you to route more or less traffic to certain resources by specifying a value, known as a bias.
Geolocation and geoproximity are both services offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that help with location-based data processing and analysis.
Geolocation is focused on determining the physical location of an object or entity, while geoproximity is focused on routing traffic based on the proximity of the user to a specific point of interest.

-Mace, Inspector, Guard duty-
Know what is AWS Macie Vs Inspector Vs Guard Duty and how they are used
AWS Macie - is a data security service that uses machine learning (ML) and pattern matching to discover and help protect your sensitive data.
Inspector - Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. – think like Splunk scanner or Splunk inspector 
GuardDuty - Amazon GuardDuty is a security monitoring service that analyzes and processes data sources, such as data events logs, CloudTrail management event logs, DNS logs, Amazon EBS volume data, Kubernetes audit logs, Amazon VPC flow logs, and RDS login activity. It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected, potentially unauthorized, and malicious activity within your AWS environment.
How they are used 

-Cron and Rate-
Now for the stuff you absolutely need to know - Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular, they will try to trick on this -- the video series does not cover this in detail at all please use this link 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html 
Research cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions. 
Be familiar with cron syntax just in case

Study Strategy -- Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding I'd recommend watching the youtube video at 2x speed first then go over the WGU materials as much of the exam will be based on that --labs are not necessary to pass but they'll def help -- I skipped the labs-- Pay close attention to Chapters 7-11 esp Chapters 7 & 11 I've added the cheatsheet from the youtube course
First off the youtube video found here is extremely useful vital IMO :
AWS SysOps Administrator Associate 2020 (PASS THE EXAM!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ

If a question mentions volume it talking about EBS
File it referring to EFS
AWS Athena is for querying S3 objects – Athena can also analyze CloudWatch logs from s3
Quite a few questions on CloudWatch, System Mgr, AWS Config and NACL/ALB.

Watch all of the AWS Academy videos
Do the knowledge checks at the end of each module
Take the Sections tests at the end of each section
Take the little practice test at the end of the material
Take the PA, open-book style. Used it to research concepts or AWS services I was not very familiar with as I went along. If I thought I knew an answer, I'd go ahead and give that question a shot without looking at any material (this is usually how I take PAs)
Take the PA later without help and made 100% (Understandably as I studied the questions awhile taking it)


Study Strategy ---- Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding I'd recommend watching the youtube video at 2x speed first then go over the WGU materials as much of the exam will be based on that --labs are not necessary to pass but they'll def help -- I skipped the labs
-- Pay close attention to Chapters 7-11 esp Chapters 7 & 11 I've added the cheatsheet from the youtube course -- see course chatter.

AWS neptune does graphing of data
Athena is for large sql data with s3 lakes
SQS vs SNS
The s is simple for both 
NS stands for notification service think like text messaging or Push notifications. SNS is typically used for applications that need realtime notifications
 SNS does not persist messages - it delivers them to subscribers that are present, and then deletes them.
 SNS can do Text and email
QS is Queueu servive like sending messages from one systm to another, comparable services is like RabbitMQ and Kafka (though not the same)
 SQS is more suited for message processing use cases
 SQS can persist messages (from 1 minute to 14 days)

AWS Control Tower automates the setup of a new landing zone using best-practices blueprints for identity, federated access, and account structure
AWS Control Tower provides three categories of guidance: mandatory, strongly recommended, and elective controls
AWS Organizations enables you to manage your environment across multiple accounts centrally, AWS Control Tower automates many of the steps required to build your environment and govern at scale
