SSM Vs EventBridge Vs OpsWork Vs Fargate

SSM – this is AWS Systems Manager, it allows you to safely automate common and repetitive IT operations and management tasks.
SSM - systems manager think patching or patch management
Know the difference between those and how they are used anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM
Think SSM patching
System Manager like a lot especially the automation documents.

-SSM Systems manager-

or cheat sheet at:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ&t=22492s
Also known as AWS Simple services manager (SSM)
SSM is an umbrella of services used to automate the management of virtual machines 
Anything pertaining to Patching will be SSM
AWS SSM patch manager automates the process of patching managed nodes with updates
 https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-patch.html
Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out.
Big two are automation and run command
SSM patch manager is just for that, patches can be installed on the regular by scheduling patches to run as a systems manager maintenance window task
2 things you need for ssm to work the SSM agent (if you’re not already using an AWS backed image) and the SSM AWS Managed policy attached your IAM role (of AmazonSSMMangedCore)

-EventBridge-

EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable.
Formally called cloudwatch events
Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular
However do extra study on LAMBDA and RATE/CRON.
EventBridge and cron expression
cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions.

Read through the Course Chatter. People mentioned that you should know EventBridge well and understand cron expressions. And to be honest, a cron question came up on the OA and I was kind of unsure about the answer because it the syntax didn't really stick with me.
I would also look over the AWS documentation for things like: EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines), etc.
Watch the EventBridge sections on the youtube video in the Course Tips
EventBridge and CloudWatch are interchangeable
Many eventbridge questions be family with it
EventBridge and how it works, the file formats used and the language. 
EventBridge is used a lot here. 
EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, SystemsManager (patch manager and patch baselines)

-OpsWorks-

OpsWorks – containers with chef or puppet
AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet
Anything that mentions containers with Chef or Puppet is OPSWORK
Opsworks is a configuration manager service that helps automate the deployments, configuration and management of infrastructure and application in the cloud. It simplifies the process of deploying and managing infrastructure and applications in the cloud it’s flexible and automated

-Fargate-
Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate
Fargate – is a server less engine that lets you focus on building applications without managing servers
Anything with Managing containers without the mention of Chef/puppet is Fargate
Fargate think container manager

-CloudFormation-

or 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ&t=40345s
Know cloud formation and the intrinsic functions.
Know cloudwatch metrics and what default metrics are tracked vs which metrics needs the cloud watch agent. 
Why you would need the cloudwatch agent: 
Used on both on-prem (not managed by aws) and aws servers it allows you to collect custom metrics like if you have specific application-level metrics you want to monitor
To install the agent package from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), using AWS Systems Manager, AWS CloudFormation, or by installing it manually using the command line.
Spend adequate time learning about CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets as well. 
CloudFormation and the functions, stuff like stacksets
Stacksets info: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/what-is-cfnstacksets.html

-Cloud Networking-

Know how VPC's are connected to onsite networks very IMPORTANT! Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out
Know how VPC's are connected to onsite network
Site to site VPN - 
Direct connect main use is on-prem to aws cloud 
VPN cloudhub
VPC peering
Transit gateway VS Direct Connect Vs Site-to-to site VPN know those inside out.
Transit gateway - 
Direct Connect - 
Site-to-site VPN - 
NAT instance vs NAT Gateway
How VPC's are connected to onsite networks:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-vpc-connectivity-options/network-to-amazon-vpc-connectivity-options.html

Know what VPC endpoints and the purpose.

-Mace, Inspector, Guard duty-
Know what is AWS Mace Vs Inspector Vs Guard Duty and how they are used
AWS Mace
Inspector
Guard duty
How they are used 
Know the difference between geolocation and geoproximity
Know what is used when Geoproximity is implemented whether it's Region/Zone or Lat/long
Geolocation
Geoproximity

-Cron and Rate-
Now for the stuff you absolutely need to know - Cron & RATE EXPRESSIONS I emphasize RATE! not regular, they will try to trick on this -- the video series does not cover this in detail at all please use this link 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/ScheduledEvents.html 
Research cron expressions and rate for Lambda functions. 
Be familiar with cron syntax just in case

Study Strategy -- Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding I'd recommend watching the youtube video at 2x speed first then go over the WGU materials as much of the exam will be based on that --labs are not necessary to pass but they'll def help -- I skipped the labs-- Pay close attention to Chapters 7-11 esp Chapters 7 & 11 I've added the cheatsheet from the youtube course
Stephane Maarek's practice tests on Udemy
First off the youtube video found here is extremely useful vital IMO :
AWS SysOps Administrator Associate 2020 (PASS THE EXAM!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_AfyrhlgQ

If a question mentions volume it talking about EBS
File it referring to EFS
AWS Athena is for querying S3 objects –
Quite a few questions on CloudWatch, System Mgr, AWS Config and NACL/ALB.

Watch all of the AWS Academy videos
Do the knowledge checks at the end of each module
Take the Sections tests at the end of each section
Take the little practice test at the end of the material
Take the PA, open-book style. Used it to research concepts or AWS services I was not very familiar with as I went along. If I thought I knew an answer, I'd go ahead and give that question a shot without looking at any material (this is usually how I take PAs)
Take the PA later without help and made 100% (Understandably as I studied the questions awhile taking it)


Study Strategy ---- Use the WGU material as your main source of study go over the youtube stuff for things you may have difficulty understanding I'd recommend watching the youtube video at 2x speed first then go over the WGU materials as much of the exam will be based on that --labs are not necessary to pass but they'll def help -- I skipped the labs
-- Pay close attention to Chapters 7-11 esp Chapters 7 & 11 I've added the cheatsheet from the youtube course -- see course chatter.
