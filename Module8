Short stuff here

•	"Cloud Storage Overview" (new tab) (9:51)

If you need:
Scalable NFS system for Linux workloads for Cloud and On-prem use EFS
Hybrid cloud storage for on-prem that uses iSCSI, SMB and NFS – Storage Gateway
Block storage ideal for database and applications - EBS

EBS volumes are network attached think link mapped drives but more native and supports boot and data volumes
EBS is network attached block storage
EBS is persistent
Snapshots are incremental and are stored in S3
Instance Store
Means non-persistent block-level on a shared subsystem 
Reclaimed when instance terminated
Idea use cases: Buffers, Cache and scratch data
Instance store is temporary block storage attached to an instance that is attached to a host
EFS is file storage for Linux based workloads
EFS uses NFS and can be used with any AMI that supports it
Multiple EC2 instances can use the same 
THINK NFS = EFS

S3 versioning protects objects from accidental deletion and override
If a delete occurs with versioning enabled it adds a delete marker, but the object is still retrievable by version ID
If a delete occurs with versioning disabled/suspended it deletes the object and is no longer retreavable
Upload object with same key with versioning enabled creates a new object with a different version ID. Both are retrievable by version ID

Knowledge check 
•	Amazon Elastic block store (Amazon EBS) volume is tied to availability zones (data centers)
•	Amazon Data lifecycle manager policies need to be specified: Resources type, Target tag, and Schedule
•	Amazon elastic block store (Amazon EBS) snapshots are based on deltas, which means that only changes to previous snapshots are saved to Amazon simple storage service (S3) (Snapshots are based on deltas)
•	Amazon EBS Elastic Block storage can be network-attached to an Amazon Elastic compute cloud (EC2) instance
•	Once versioning is enabled on S3 buckets it cannot be disabled 
•	AWS Lambda, SQS (all)
•	Instance store (ephemeral) is best suited as a cache or buffer
•	S3 glacier takes 5-12 hours to retrieve archived data by using the bulk retrieve option 
•	Amazon EFS can span across multiple availability zones in different regions
•	Versioning enabled would result in the addition of a marker when an object is deleted
