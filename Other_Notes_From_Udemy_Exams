•	Max CIDR Size in AWS is /16
•	Security groups are stateful and if traffic can go out it can go back in
•	NAT Gateway is a seamless and scalable way to provide internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets
•	VPC peering need to be configured on both ends
•	Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource to span Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to spread across multiple AWS Regions
•	Amazon S3 and DynamoDB have a VPC gateway endpoint 
Gateway endpoint in AWS - Gateway endpoints do not enable AWS PrivateLink.no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.
Types of endpoints in VPCs:
	Gateway -is a gateway that you specify in your route table to access Amazon S3 from your VPC over the AWS network
	Interface - extend the functionality of gateway endpoints by using private IP addresses to route requests to Amazon S3 from within your VPC, on premises, or from a VPC in another AWS Region using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway

•	The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available
For example in 10.0.0.0/24 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.255 are not available.
•	0.0 Network address
•	0.1 Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
•	0.2 Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two
•	0.3 Reserved for Future use
•	0.255 Network broadcast address

•	If EC2 instances are not getting assigned public hostnames and DNS isn’t working check to make sure Enable DNS Resolution and DNS hostnames in your VPC
•	Peering connections (again) need to be set up again on both sides
•	Enabling VPC flow logs helps you capture information inside your VPCs
•	Hosted connections in AWS: 
Speeds: For hosted connections, the possible values are 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 400 Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, and 10 Gbps
Dedicated (Direct) port speed values are 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 100 Gbps
Why hosted connections over dedicated? This is a good question
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithConnections.html
FYI Hosted offers slower speeds dedicated does “modern” port speeds
•	VPC Endpoint services is a good way to allow internal web applications to not to be exposed to the internet

Redoing this quiz (lots of cloudwatch stuff)
https://wgu.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/learn/quiz/5293388#overview
•	A CloudWatch Logs metric filter can be created to filter for the word “Error” to then have a CloudWatch alarm based on that metric filter
•	A Unified CloudWatch Agent can push memory usage as a custom metric to CloudWatch in order to monitor EC2 memory usage
•	Compliance can be evaluated using AWS config 
•	If a configuration falls out of config AWS CloudTrail is a good way to find out who made the change
•	KMS key policies controls access to KMS CMKs
•	AWS Guard duty does not scan CloudWatch Logs
•	You cannot run security assessments against Route 53
•	AWS WAF  protects against common attacks like SQL injection
•	Since RDS is a SAS product you only have to worry about things like Security group rules
*** Only write down what you learned ***
•	Amazon inspector allows you to analyze weekly for OS vulnerabilities
•	Amazon guard duty is good for instances where you dev team might store credentials in the public and you want to make sure they don’t and notify you when they do
•	AWS certificate manager is not integrated with EC2, it is however included with Elastic load balancer, Cloud front and API gateway
•	AWS secrets manager is most suitable for storing RDS DB passwords with automatic rotation
•	Amazon Cognito identify federation is ideal for giving your users access to their own personal space (via a mobile application) in S3
•	IAM Access analyzer find resources that are accessible from outside of your AWS account 
•	Amazon Cognito identify pools  can provide unauthenticated guess access to web applications hosted using AWS amplify

Section 16 Monitoring auditing and performance 
**CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config **
CloudWatch 
•	Performance monitoring (metric, CPU, network etc..) and dashboards
•	Events and alerting
•	Log aggregation and analysis
CloudTrail
•	Record API calls made within your account by everyone
•	Can define trails for specific resources 
•	Global search
Config
•	Record configuration changes
•	Evaluate resources against compliance rules
•	Get timeline of changes and compliance
Note: EC2 memory usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed from inside the instance as a custom metric
