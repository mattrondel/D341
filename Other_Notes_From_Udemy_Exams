•	Max CIDR Size in AWS is /16
•	Security groups are stateful and if traffic can go out it can go back in
•	NAT Gateway is a seamless and scalable way to provide internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets
•	VPC peering need to be configured on both ends
•	Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource to span Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to spread across multiple AWS Regions
•	Amazon S3 and DynamoDB have a VPC gateway endpoint 
Gateway endpoint in AWS - Gateway endpoints do not enable AWS PrivateLink.no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.
Types of endpoints in VPCs:
	Gateway -is a gateway that you specify in your route table to access Amazon S3 from your VPC over the AWS network
	Interface - extend the functionality of gateway endpoints by using private IP addresses to route requests to Amazon S3 from within your VPC, on premises, or from a VPC in another AWS Region using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway

•	The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available
For example in 10.0.0.0/24 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.255 are not available.
•	0.0 Network address
•	0.1 Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
•	0.2 Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two
•	0.3 Reserved for Future use
•	0.255 Network broadcast address

•	If EC2 instances are not getting assigned public hostnames and DNS isn’t working check to make sure Enable DNS Resolution and DNS hostnames in your VPC
•	Peering connections (again) need to be set up again on both sides
•	Enabling VPC flow logs helps you capture information inside your VPCs
•	Hosted connections in AWS: 
Speeds: For hosted connections, the possible values are 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 400 Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, and 10 Gbps
Dedicated (Direct) port speed values are 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 100 Gbps
Why hosted connections over dedicated? This is a good question
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithConnections.html
FYI Hosted offers slower speeds dedicated does “modern” port speeds
•	VPC Endpoint services is a good way to allow internal web applications to not to be exposed to the internet 
•	
Redoing this quiz (lots of cloudwatch stuff)
https://wgu.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/learn/quiz/5293388#overview
•	A CloudWatch Logs metric filter can be created to filter for the word “Error” to then have a CloudWatch alarm based on that metric filter
•	A Unified CloudWatch Agent can push memory usage as a custom metric to CloudWatch in order to monitor EC2 memory usage
•	Compliance can be evaluated using AWS config 
•	If a configuration falls out of config AWS CloudTrail is a good way to find out who made the change
