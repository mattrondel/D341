•	Max CIDR Size in AWS is /16
•	Security groups are stateful and if traffic can go out it can go back in
•	NAT Gateway is a seamless and scalable way to provide internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets
•	VPC peering need to be configured on both ends
•	Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource to span Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) to spread across multiple AWS Regions
•	Amazon S3 and DynamoDB have a VPC gateway endpoint 
Gateway endpoint in AWS - Gateway endpoints do not enable AWS PrivateLink.no additional charge for using gateway endpoints.
Types of endpoints in VPCs:
	Gateway -is a gateway that you specify in your route table to access Amazon S3 from your VPC over the AWS network
	Interface - extend the functionality of gateway endpoints by using private IP addresses to route requests to Amazon S3 from within your VPC, on premises, or from a VPC in another AWS Region using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway
Additional reading on these endpoints
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html#types-of-vpc-endpoints-for-s3
•	The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available
For example in 10.0.0.0/24 10.0.0.0 through 10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.255 are not available.
•	0.0 Network address
•	0.1 Reserved by AWS for the VPC router
•	0.2 Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two
•	0.3 Reserved for Future use
•	0.255 Network broadcast address

Subnets for your VPC - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/privatelink-interface-endpoints.html#types-of-vpc-endpoints-for-s3
•	If EC2 instances are not getting assigned public hostnames and DNS isn’t working check to make sure Enable DNS Resolution and DNS hostnames in your VPC
•	Peering connections (again) need to be set up again on both sides
•	Enabling VPC flow logs helps you capture information inside your VPCs
•	Hosted connections in AWS: 
Speeds: For hosted connections, the possible values are 50 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 200 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 400 Mbps, 500 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 2 Gbps, 5 Gbps, and 10 Gbps
Dedicated (Direct) port speed values are 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps, and 100 Gbps
Why hosted connections over dedicated? This is a good question
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/WorkingWithConnections.html
FYI Hosted offers slower speeds dedicated does “modern” port speeds
•	VPC Endpoint services is a good way to allow internal web applications to not to be exposed to the internet 
•	
Redoing this quiz (lots of cloudwatch stuff)
https://wgu.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/learn/quiz/5293388#overview
•	A CloudWatch Logs metric filter can be created to filter for the word “Error” to then have a CloudWatch alarm based on that metric filter
•	A Unified CloudWatch Agent can push memory usage as a custom metric to CloudWatch in order to monitor EC2 memory usage
•	Compliance can be evaluated using AWS config 
•	If a configuration falls out of config AWS CloudTrail is a good way to find out who made the change
•	KMS key policies controls access to KMS CMKs
•	AWS Guard duty does not scan CloudWatch Logs
•	You cannot run security assessments against Route 53
•	AWS WAF  protects against common attacks like SQL injection
•	Since RDS is a SAS product you only have to worry about things like Security group rules
*** Only write down what you learned ***
•	Amazon inspector allows you to analyze weekly for OS vulnerabilities
•	Amazon guard duty is good for instances where you dev team might store credentials in the public and you want to make sure they don’t and notify you when they do
•	AWS certificate manager is not integrated with EC2, it is however included with Elastic load balancer, Cloud front and API gateway
•	AWS secrets manager is most suitable for storing RDS DB passwords with automatic rotation
•	Amazon Cognito identify federation is ideal for giving your users access to their own personal space (via a mobile application) in S3
•	IAM Access analyzer find resources that are accessible from outside of your AWS account 
•	Amazon Cognito identify pools  can provide unauthenticated guess access to web applications hosted using AWS amplify

Section 16 Monitoring auditing and performance 
**CloudWatch vs CloudTrail vs Config **
CloudWatch 
•	Performance monitoring (metric, CPU, network etc..) and dashboards
•	Events and alerting
•	Log aggregation and analysis
CloudTrail
•	Record API calls made within your account by everyone
•	Can define trails for specific resources 
•	Global search
Config
•	Record configuration changes
•	Evaluate resources against compliance rules
•	Get timeline of changes and compliance
Note: EC2 memory usage is by default not pushed (must be pushed from inside the instance as a custom metric

Quizes through udemy, go through them then at the end jot them down, look up stuff you don’t know, like CORS and MFA Delete
--
Section 13 Storage Quiz
Storage gateway VM needs port 80 open 
--
Section 12 S3 security 
SSE-C – server-side encryption with customer provided keys, c for customer
SSE-S3 - server-side encryption with S3-managed encryption keys
SSE-KMS - server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service
Athena provides a simplified, flexible way to analyze petabytes of data where it lives. (Assuming access logs are huge)
•	CORS – cross origin resource sharing, without CORS this would prevent a web page from calling APIs in a different domain like S3 object being called like webpages. A website might load files from an S3 bucket if CORS is wrong then it wont work.
•	S3 pre-signed URL - are used to provide short-term access to a private object in your S3 bucket.
•	MFA delete can help prevent accidental bucket deletions by requiring the user who initiates the delete action to prove physical possession of an MFA device. If you want to enable S3 versioning with MFA delete you need to enable s3 versioning too
•	aws:sourceVpce is a policy condition to restrict access from specific VPC endpoints e for endpoints
•	S3 Access Points are good for managing large datasets you no longer need to manage a single complex bucket policy with 100’s of permissions. S3 access points allow you to create application specific access points permitting access to shared datasets with polices tailored to the specific application
•	Enabling Default encryption on an s3 bucket is how to enable encryption by default (duh) or you can use a bucket policy to deny uploads without encryption like s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption
---
Section 10 S3 intro quiz
•	Newly enabled versioning in an S3 bucket the existing files will have a null value for versioning
•	S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is a low cost and low latency to make a bucket available in different regions 
•	In order to enable S3 replication between 2 buckets you first need version enabled on both sides
•	Amazon glacier is slow like melting a glacier it takes hours not minutes
•	Glacier flexible storage modes can be as quick as 1-5 minutes, 3-5 hours, or 5-12 hours but not seconds
•	S3 bucket names are globally unique names like dev are probably taken already
---
Section 11 advanced S3 and Athena
---
•	S3 Analytics is a good way to get recommendations for S3 lifecycle rules
•	Files that are no longer needed (deleted) need to expire (expiration actions)
•	Athena is server less for data analysis 
•	S3 inventory can generate reports on replication and encryption status on objects in s3
---
Section 7 quiz
Elastic beanstalk for sysops 
•	To speed up runtime and OS dependences and deployment through elastic beanstalk you can package and deploy a golden AMI
•	Worker environment tier in ELB is a service to quickly host your applications, its an application that handles background-processing tasks.
•	Web server environment tier in ELB is an a web application that handles HTTP(S) requests
---
Section 6 HA and scalability
---
•	Sticky sessions on application load balancer…
•	Network load balancer, network stuff’
•	A public IPv4 address is not a valid target while you create a target group for your application load balancer – not sure what this means
Pick up from here: https://wgu.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/learn/quiz/5293276#overview

here too:
https://wgu.udemy.com/course/ultimate-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/learn/quiz/5293272#overview
•	HTTP is an application thus needs application load balancer
---
Section 15 - Databases for sysops
---
•	RDS Proxy?
•	Read replicas can’t be encrypted if the master DB isn’t
•	5 is your max RDS DB read replicas
•	AWS Config can ensure that all ec2 instances are launched using approved AMIs
•	Cost allocation tags allow you to separate costs into categories in AWS like environment
•	AWS cost explorer can give you recommendations for type of reserved ec2 instances you should buy into to optimize costs
•	AWS budgets will notify you when costs exceed thresholds
Other services
•	Kibana supports the following authentication mechanisms: Multiple authentication providers. Basic authentication. Token authentication. Blahh not sure what this is –

Changing gears
Do this exam but lookup what you don’t know before you answer it
“borrow” from the azure app of look for the answer, (use expanded view)
** Then lets do this with the PA**
https://wgu.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/learn/quiz/5107000/test#overview
Listen to this stuff too:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVbUNRwpXzw&t=296s
Put in # next to what you ether learn or comments like I don’t know but I wish I knew so when you go back you can recall thoughts, but make an effort to lookup what might be correct. Look up services your not sure about
•	Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable MFA delete you can only set it up with the CLI or API
•	#7 enable default encryption in s3?
•	#8 stickiness on application load balancer
•	#9 not sure
•	 #10 subnet question
•	#11 database question I put Athena because it queries large amount of data but I didn’t look up other products

after reading this reddit post I was thinking to stick closer to the main material
https://old.reddit.com/r/WGUIT/comments/y2ospb/9_days_in_this_class_got_burnt_out_quick_and_just/
---------------------- 2-15-2023----------------------
•	Watched all of the AWS Academy videos
•	Did the knowledge checks at the end of each module
Starting from top to bottom lets lookup answers we don’t know notating what I didn’t know

Module 1:
https://cgp-oex.wgu.edu/courses/course-v1:WGUx+OEX0032+v01/courseware/c9ce4f8b0b8d4d59b7d29e73150c56a9/d8936707cfcb4947bbc9b095ae21c2be/2?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AWGUx%2BOEX0032%2Bv01%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%406ae51b6ad8e14654acd99204610fb8e5

if you feel like you need it do the quiz a second time reading the stuff you got wrong and figure out why it’s right (if you can)
•	ACLs are not defined within JSON documents they use? _____-looking for this answer through the videos, funny as they don’t have it
•	Policy rule evaluations for IAM: an explicit ALLOW overrides the default denial of access to all resources unless an explicit DENT overrides it, all polices are evaluated before a request is allowed of denied and the evaluation order of the polices has no effect on outcome.
•	AWS CLI supports ACSII-formatted tables, JSON, and Tab-delimited text (it actually can do others the this is the AWS correct for this test)

Module 2
•	With AWS system manager you can put bash script commands into a command document that systems manager can run “AWS Systems Manager centralizes operational data from multiple AWS services and automates tasks across your AWS resources.”
•	OpsWorks offerings are: Chef automate, OpsWorks for Puppet, and Stacks
•	There are different SDKs for each programming languages supported by AWS
•	AWS Systems Manager Insights provide a dashboard for viewing operational data

Module 3
https://cgp-oex.wgu.edu/courses/course-v1:WGUx+OEX0032+v01/courseware/04c9f97860cb4a2abb91f13af016e906/95391ae470ae4870af5ad38e071343e9/2?activate_block_id=block-v1%3AWGUx%2BOEX0032%2Bv01%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%4083c7a67134da406fa0c17a31cc27f701
•	AMIs provide the required information that is needed to launch an instance
•	The first step when implementing an AMZ EC2 instance is to determine the AMI that will be used
•	A running lifecycle state retains the public IP address of the Ec2 instance when you stop, terminate you lose the state of the public IP address, reboots keep it
•	An instance profile is a container that allow AWS IAM role information to be attached to an EC2 instance. “An instance profile is a container for an IAM role that you can use to pass role information to an Amazon EC2 instance when the instance starts”
•	Module 4

•	Route 53 is a cheap way to route end users to Ec2 and ELBs
•	If an Auto scaling group cannot scale up in EC2 CPU utilization increases to match capacity with auto scaling
•	ALBs support containers
•	Health checks are performed on all targets that are registered to a group
•	An ALB (application based load balancer) supports content-based routing (application = content)
•	Creating alarms that are only triggered by sustained changes can reduce thrashing

•	Elastic container registry (ECR) can store, manage and deploy Docker images with considerations for encryption, 3rd party integrations and HA
•	Fargate is a managed service for running containers
•	S3 server side encryption is provides data at rest encryption
•	Elastic container server for Kubernetes (EKS) is over multiple AZs – not regions
