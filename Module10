----------------------------------------
Module 10 knowledge check
•	Inherited tags count towards the total tag limit for a resource.
•	Month-to-date Spend by Service displays a graph that illustrates the most used resources and the proportional costs of their use. – This shows the top services that you use most and the proportion of your costs that service contributed to.
•	AWS Trusted Advisor can identify underutilized load balancers and volumes. It provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.
•	AWS Config can be used to define and enforce required tags – IAM and organizations can do that too but that was not an option
•	AWS Cost Explorer displays visualizations of high-level historical and current and current account costs, but Costs and Usage Reports generate granular usage reports in comma-separated values (CSV) format. (Think reports create csv files)
•	Amazon CloudWatch should be used to find instances that are running idle and increasing costs (think watching your cloud usage IDK?)
•	AWS Budgets, a feature of Billing and cost management, enables monitoring and notifications on a daily or weekly basis. Think budgets monitor spending
•	Using a stopinator script is a best practice for reducing costs – think its got a funny name with stop in it
•	AWS Config can evaluate a rule on demand, or based on a trigger (for example, when a resource is created or modified) it will also evaluate when resources are running or not – think config doesn’t care if its running or not like SolarWinds does
•	IAM policies can enforce the use of tags for creating resources
