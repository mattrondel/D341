•	"Managing Resource Consumption" (new tab) (0:59)
You will learn how to manage resource consumption by using tags and various cost management tools and best practices
Topics: tagging
Cost management tools and best practices
AWS trusted advisor
Labs: Guided lab: managing resources with tagging
Challenge lab: optimize AWS resource utilization
Tools and resources include tagging, CloudWatch and trusted advisor 
You should be able to describe how to enforce tagging with AWS identity and access management policies

•	"Tagging" (new tab) (8:15)
A tag is a label that you assigned to an AWS resource it enables you to identify or categorize the resource in a meaningful way. 
A tag consists of a key and a value which you define. 
A Tag: is a key-value pair that can be attached to an AWS resource
Allows you to identify and categorize resources.
There are a few important things to remember about tags:
•	You can tag many resources such as EC2, EBS, etc during creation.
•	Separate tagging action is needed after the resource is created.
•	Tag keys and values are case-sensitive
•	Best practice is to use a consistent standard format 
•	Some tags are built-in and cannot be removed. 
•	Tag names with the aws:prefix are built-in for example, aws:createdBy or aws:cloudformation:<stack-name> tag.
•	There are limits to the number of tags that you can create. 
•	Maximum of 50 per resource
•	You can only assign a tag to a resource after it is created
•	Tag keys and values are case sensitive 
•	A best practice is to use a consistent naming convention for AWS resources and tags.
•	You cannot edit or delete tag keys or values with the aws:prefix. These tags are assigned by aws in a reserved for AWS use.
•	Some tags are propagated or inherited. This is seen in services that can create other AWS resources, such as CloudFormation and Elastic Beanstalk. Generally when one of these services creates a resource, it tags that resource with a reference to itself. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/required-tags.html
Companies can also use tags to organize billing reports that reflect internal cost structures, and to achieve more accurate reporting for cost allocation.
You can also write IAM policies that encored the use of specific tags. For example, you could use an IAM policy to enforce the use of the department and cost center tags when you create a resource. You can use these tags to develop more accurate reporting for cost allocation.
You can implement your tagging strategy with IAM policies in many ways. For example, you can use an IAM policy to block the deletion of tags required by corporate standards or compliance requirements.
You express tagging requirements in an IAM policy through the condition policy element.
For more information about tagging ec2 instances and EBS volumes when they’re created, search for tag ec2 instances on Creation in the AWS documentation.
Best practices for tagging:
•	Create business-relevant tag groupings to organize resources along technical, business, and security dimensions. 
•	Always use more tags than too few tags
•	Use meaningful names for both tag keys and values
•	Always use a standardized, case-sensitive format for tags, and implement it consistency across all resource groups
•	Implement automated tools to help manage resource tags. For example use the Resource Groups Tagging API. With this API you can programmatically control tags. For example, you can use the API to tag and untag supported resources. You can also use the API to list all existing tag keys for an account.
•	Always use meaningful names for both the tag and key values. These names should be relevant to your project or business needed, and be as descriptive as possible. For more information about tagging strategies, search for tagging strategies in the AWS documentation.

Module 10 knowledge check
•	Inherited tags count towards the total tag limit for a resource.
•	Month-to-date Spend by Service displays a graph that illustrates the most used resources and the proportional costs of their use. – This shows the top services that you use most and the proportion of your costs that service contributed to.
•	AWS Trusted Advisor can identify underutilized load balancers and volumes. It provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.
•	AWS Config can be used to define and enforce required tags – IAM and organizations can do that too but that was not an option
•	AWS Cost Explorer displays visualizations of high-level historical and current and current account costs, but Costs and Usage Reports generate granular usage reports in comma-separated values (CSV) format. (Think reports create csv files)
•	Amazon CloudWatch should be used to find instances that are running idle and increasing costs (think watching your cloud usage IDK?)
•	AWS Budgets, a feature of Billing and cost management, enables monitoring and notifications on a daily or weekly basis. Think budgets monitor spending
•	Using a stopinator script is a best practice for reducing costs – think its got a funny name with stop in it
•	AWS Config can evaluate a rule on demand, or based on a trigger (for example, when a resource is created or modified) it will also evaluate when resources are running or not – think config doesn’t care if its running or not like SolarWinds does
•	IAM policies can enforce the use of tags for creating resources

lets take notes on tagging and do exercises
