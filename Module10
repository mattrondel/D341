•	"Managing Resource Consumption" (new tab) (0:59)
You will learn how to manage resource consumption by using tags and various cost management tools and best practices

Topics: tagging
Cost management tools and best practices
AWS trusted advisor
Labs: Guided lab: managing resources with tagging
Challenge lab: optimize AWS resource utilization

Tools and resources include tagging, CloudWatch and trusted advisor 
You should be able to describe how to enforce tagging with AWS identity and access management policies

•	"Tagging" (new tab) (8:15)
A tag is a label that you assigned to an AWS resource it enables you to identify or categorize the resource in a meaningful way. A tag consists of a key and a value which you define. 
A Tag: is a key-value pair that can be attached to an AWS resource
Allows you to identify and categorize resources.

----------------------------------------
Module 10 knowledge check
•	Inherited tags count towards the total tag limit for a resource.
•	Month-to-date Spend by Service displays a graph that illustrates the most used resources and the proportional costs of their use. – This shows the top services that you use most and the proportion of your costs that service contributed to.
•	AWS Trusted Advisor can identify underutilized load balancers and volumes. It provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices.
•	AWS Config can be used to define and enforce required tags – IAM and organizations can do that too but that was not an option
•	AWS Cost Explorer displays visualizations of high-level historical and current and current account costs, but Costs and Usage Reports generate granular usage reports in comma-separated values (CSV) format. (Think reports create csv files)
•	Amazon CloudWatch should be used to find instances that are running idle and increasing costs (think watching your cloud usage IDK?)
•	AWS Budgets, a feature of Billing and cost management, enables monitoring and notifications on a daily or weekly basis. Think budgets monitor spending
•	Using a stopinator script is a best practice for reducing costs – think its got a funny name with stop in it
•	AWS Config can evaluate a rule on demand, or based on a trigger (for example, when a resource is created or modified) it will also evaluate when resources are running or not – think config doesn’t care if its running or not like SolarWinds does
•	IAM policies can enforce the use of tags for creating resources

lets take notes on tagging and do exercises
